      title: "Automated AI Visibility Optimization System with Reinforcement Learning and Predictive Analytics",
      abstract: `
        A computer-implemented system and method for continuously optimizing AI visibility metrics 
        in search engines and AI platforms using reinforcement learning algorithms, Kalman filtering, 
        and predictive analytics. The system automatically adjusts pillar weights, predicts future 
        performance trajectories, and optimizes marketing spend allocation to maximize organic 
        search performance and return on investment.
      `,
      background: `
        Current AI visibility optimization systems rely on static algorithms and manual adjustments, 
        leading to suboptimal performance and inefficient resource allocation. There is a need for 
        an automated system that can continuously learn and adapt to changing AI search algorithms 
        and market conditions.
      `,
      summary: `
        The present invention provides an automated AI visibility optimization system that uses 
        reinforcement learning to continuously improve performance metrics. The system includes 
        data ingestion, model calibration, weight reinforcement, trajectory prediction, marketing 
        optimization, and benchmark reporting components.
