## Integration Instructions

### Step 1: Update Main Landing Page
Integrate all 5 components into your PLG landing page (likely `/app/page.tsx` or `/components/landing/plg/advanced-plg-landing.tsx`):

```tsx
import ROICalculator from '@/components/landing/ROICalculator';
import SessionCounter from '@/components/landing/SessionCounter';
import ShareToUnlock from '@/components/landing/ShareToUnlock';
import CompetitiveRageBait from '@/components/landing/CompetitiveRageBait';
import OnboardingBridge from '@/components/landing/OnboardingBridge';

// In your landing page component:
const [isUnlocked, setIsUnlocked] = useState(false);
const [scanResults, setScanResults] = useState(null);

// After scan completes:
{scanResults && (
  <>
    {/* Part 6: ROI Calculator */}
    <ROICalculator />

    {/* Part 7: Live Session Counter */}
    <SessionCounter />

    {/* Part 9: Competitive Rage Bait */}
    <CompetitiveRageBait
      dealerName={scanResults.dealerName}
      dealerScore={scanResults.aiVisibilityScore}
      marketLeaderScore={87}
      onCtaClick={() => setShowShareGate(true)}
    />

    {/* Part 8: Share-to-Unlock Gate */}
    <ShareToUnlock
      dealerName={scanResults.dealerName}
      revenueAtRisk={scanResults.revenueAtRisk}
      onUnlock={() => setIsUnlocked(true)}
      isUnlocked={isUnlocked}
    />

    {/* Part 10: Onboarding Bridge (only after unlock) */}
    {isUnlocked && (
      <OnboardingBridge
        scanResults={scanResults}
        isUnlocked={isUnlocked}
      />
    )}
  </>
)}
```

### Step 2: Update Onboarding Flow
In `/app/onboarding-3d/page.tsx`, retrieve context from sessionStorage:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const contextStr = sessionStorage.getItem('onboarding_context');
  if (contextStr) {
    const context = JSON.parse(contextStr);
    // Pre-fill dealer info, missions, etc.
    setDealerName(context.dealerName);
    setMissions(context.suggestedMissions);
    // ... etc
  }
}, []);
```

### Step 3: Configure Redis (Optional but Recommended)
Set environment variables for Redis:

```bash
# .env.local
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
# OR for Upstash (serverless Redis):
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...
```

If Redis is not configured, all components gracefully fall back to mock data.

### Step 4: Email Service Integration (Optional)
In `/app/api/landing/email-unlock/route.ts`, uncomment and configure email sending:

```tsx
// Integrate with SendGrid, Resend, or your email service
await sendEmailReport({
  to: email,
  dealerName,
  revenueAtRisk,
  templateId: 'ai-visibility-report',
});
```

---

## Analytics & Tracking

All API endpoints include Redis-backed analytics:

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
1. **Scan Completion Rate** - `/api/landing/session-stats` GET → scansToday
2. **Share Rate** - `/api/landing/track-share` GET → todayByPlatform
3. **Email Capture Rate** - `/api/landing/email-unlock` GET → todayCount
4. **Onboarding Conversion Rate** - `/api/landing/track-onboarding-start` GET → todayCount

### Funnel Metrics:
```
Visitors → Scans → Unlocks (Share/Email) → Onboarding Starts → Signups
```

### Calculate Conversion Rates:
```javascript
const scanRate = scansToday / activeSessions;
const unlockRate = (sharesCount + emailsCount) / scansToday;
const onboardingRate = onboardingsCount / (sharesCount + emailsCount);
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Client-Side Optimizations:
- All components use `'use client'` directive (client components)
- useState hooks for local state management
- useEffect for data fetching with cleanup
- Debounced/throttled calculations where appropriate

### Server-Side Optimizations:
- All API routes use `export const runtime = 'edge'` for faster responses
- `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` prevents stale data
- Redis operations batched with Promise.all() where possible
- Cache-Control headers on session-stats endpoint (10s max age)

### Redis Optimizations:
- Automatic expiration on all keys (prevent memory bloat)
- Rolling lists limited to last 100/1000 entries (LTRIM)
- Sorted sets for efficient time-range queries (ZCOUNT)
- Deduplication with sets (SADD for unique emails)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Redis?
- Fast in-memory operations for real-time stats
- Built-in expiration for automatic cleanup
- Atomic operations prevent race conditions
- Serverless-friendly (Upstash)
- Graceful degradation if unavailable

### Why SessionStorage (not localStorage)?
- Auto-cleanup on tab close (privacy)
- Isolated per-tab (no cross-tab interference)
- Perfect for temporary onboarding context
- No GDPR concerns (not persistent)

### Why Edge Runtime?
- Faster API responses (no cold starts)
- Better global distribution
- Lower costs vs. serverless functions
- Perfect for read-heavy operations

### Why Client Components?
- Interactive UI requires state management
- Real-time updates via polling
- Animation and transitions
- Browser-only APIs (sessionStorage, window)
