Subject: Your dealership is invisible to 67% of car shoppers

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Dealership Name] isn't showing up when people ask ChatGPT "best [Brand] dealer in [City]."

67% of car shoppers now start with AI assistants. If your dealership isn't in their training data, you're losing to competitors cited 200+ times monthly.

We built DealershipAI to solve this. It's like having a Bloomberg Terminal for your AI visibility.

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo to see your current AI visibility score?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```
