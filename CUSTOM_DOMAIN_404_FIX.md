# 🚨 Custom Domain 404 Fix: dash.dealershipai.com

## 🎯 **Your Domain:** `dash.dealershipai.com`

### **🔍 Step 1: Check Vercel Domain Configuration**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - [https://vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click on your `dealership-ai-dashboard` project
   - Go to **Settings** → **Domains**

2. **Check Domain Status:**
   - Look for `dash.dealershipai.com`
   - Status should be:
     - ✅ **Valid** = Domain working correctly
     - ❌ **Invalid** = DNS configuration issue
     - ⏳ **Pending** = Still propagating (wait 24-48 hours)

### **🌐 Step 2: Test Your Domain URLs**

Try these URLs in order:

1. **Homepage:** `https://dash.dealershipai.com/`
2. **Dashboard:** `https://dash.dealershipai.com/dashboard`
3. **Test Page:** `https://dash.dealershipai.com/test-deployment`
4. **API Test:** `https://dash.dealershipai.com/api/test-deployment`
5. **Admin:** `https://dash.dealershipai.com/admin`

### **🔧 Step 3: Check DNS Configuration**

**Test DNS resolution:**
```bash
# Check if domain resolves to Vercel
nslookup dash.dealershipai.com
dig dash.dealershipai.com
```

**Expected result:** Should point to Vercel's IP addresses (76.76.19.61 or similar)

### **🚨 Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: DNS Not Propagated**
- **Symptom:** Domain doesn't resolve or points to wrong server
- **Solution:** Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- **Check:** Use `nslookup` or `dig` commands

#### **Issue 2: SSL Certificate Pending**
- **Symptom:** HTTPS doesn't work, HTTP might work
- **Solution:** Wait for Vercel to provision SSL certificate
- **Check:** Try both `http://` and `https://`

#### **Issue 3: Wrong DNS Records**
- **Symptom:** Domain points to wrong server
- **Solution:** Update DNS records to point to Vercel
- **Required DNS Records:**
  ```
  Type: CNAME
  Name: dash
  Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
  TTL: 300
  ```

#### **Issue 4: Domain Not Added to Vercel**
- **Symptom:** Domain not showing in Vercel dashboard
- **Solution:** Add domain in Vercel Settings → Domains

### **🛠️ Step 5: Quick Fixes**

#### **Option A: Use Vercel's Default URL**
While waiting for custom domain:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Domains
2. Find the `.vercel.app` URL
3. Test with that URL first

#### **Option B: Force SSL Certificate**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Domains
2. Click on `dash.dealershipai.com`
3. Click "Force HTTPS" if available

#### **Option C: Check Build Status**
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Ensure latest deployment is "Ready"
3. Redeploy if needed

### **🧪 Step 6: Test Commands**

**Test domain resolution:**
```bash
# Check DNS
nslookup dash.dealershipai.com

# Test HTTP
curl -I http://dash.dealershipai.com/

# Test HTTPS
curl -I https://dash.dealershipai.com/
```

### **📊 Step 7: Expected Results**

**If working correctly:**
- ✅ `https://dash.dealershipai.com/` shows DealershipAI homepage
- ✅ `https://dash.dealershipai.com/dashboard` shows dashboard with metrics
- ✅ `https://dash.dealershipai.com/test-deployment` shows green success page
- ✅ `https://dash.dealershipai.com/api/test-deployment` returns JSON

**If still getting 404:**
- Check Vercel deployment status
- Verify DNS configuration
- Wait for propagation (up to 48 hours)

### **🔄 Step 8: Force Redeploy**

**If deployment is stuck:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
2. Click "..." menu on latest deployment
3. Select "Redeploy"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for completion

### **🚨 Step 9: Emergency Fallback**

**If custom domain isn't working:**
1. Use Vercel's default `.vercel.app` URL temporarily
2. Fix DNS configuration
3. Switch back to custom domain once working

### **📋 Step 10: Verification Checklist**
