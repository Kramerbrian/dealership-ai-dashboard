### **Track These KPIs Weekly**

#### **Conversion Metrics**
```sql
-- Landing page conversion
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as visitors,
  SUM(CASE WHEN signed_up = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as signups,
  (SUM(CASE WHEN signed_up = true THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::float / COUNT(*) * 100) as conversion_rate
FROM page_views
WHERE page = '/landing'
AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Expected: conversion_rate increases from 2.0% to 2.5%+ over 14 days
```

#### **Email Capture (Exit Intent)**
```sql

```

#### **Pricing Toggle Usage**
```sql
-- Annual vs Monthly selection
SELECT
  billing_period,
