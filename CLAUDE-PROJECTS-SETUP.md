```

## üéØ Specific Use Cases

### **1. Understanding the Architecture**

"What's the relationship between tenants, users, and dealerships?"
```

### **2. Adding New Features**
```
"I want to add a new 'Market Analysis' tab to the dashboard. What components do I need to create?"
"Help me implement SSO integration for enterprise customers"
"Create a new API endpoint for bulk operations on multiple dealerships"
```

### **3. Security & Compliance**
```
"What security measures do I need for SOC 2 compliance?"
"How do I implement audit logging for sensitive operations?"
"What data encryption requirements do I need for enterprise customers?"
```

### **4. Performance & Scaling**
```
"How can I optimize the system for 5,000+ concurrent users?"
"What's the best strategy for handling peak traffic during business hours?"
"How do I implement proper database indexing for multi-tenant queries?"
```

### **5. Business Logic**
```
"How do I calculate the AI visibility score for a dealership?"
"What's the algorithm for geographic pooling in the cache system?"
"How do I implement the synthetic variance to make scores believable?"
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### **Phase 1: Architecture Understanding**
1. Upload all architecture files
2. Ask Claude to explain the system
3. Understand the multi-tenant patterns
4. Review the RBAC implementation

### **Phase 2: Feature Development**
1. Describe the new feature you want
2. Ask Claude to generate the code
3. Review the generated code for security
4. Test and iterate

### **Phase 3: Optimization**
1. Ask Claude to review performance
2. Get suggestions for improvements
3. Implement optimizations
4. Monitor results

## üìä Example Conversations

### **Understanding Multi-Tenancy**
```
You: "How does the tenant isolation work in this system?"

Claude: "The tenant isolation system works through multiple layers:

1. **Database Level**: Row-Level Security (RLS) policies automatically filter all queries by tenant_id
2. **Middleware Level**: The tenant-isolation middleware extracts the user's tenant_id and adds it to the request context
3. **API Level**: All tRPC procedures check ctx.user.tenant_id before executing queries
4. **Frontend Level**: Components only receive data for the current user's tenant

This ensures that a Dealership Admin can never see data from another dealership, even if there's a bug in the application code."
```

### **Adding a New Feature**
```
You: "I want to add a 'Competitor Analysis' feature that shows how a dealership compares to local competitors. What do I need to build?"

Claude: "For a Competitor Analysis feature, you'll need:

1. **Database Schema**: Add a competitors table with relationships to dealerships
2. **API Endpoint**: Create a new tRPC router for competitor data
3. **Frontend Component**: Build a CompetitorAnalysis component
4. **Data Service**: Create a service to fetch and compare competitor data
5. **Caching**: Add competitor data to the cache warming script

Let me generate the code for each of these components following your established patterns..."
```

### **Security Review**
```
You: "Review the user management API for security vulnerabilities"

Claude: "I've reviewed the user management API and found several security considerations:

**Strengths:**
- Proper RBAC permission checks
- Tenant isolation enforced
- Input validation with Zod
- Audit logging implemented

**Recommendations:**
- Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Implement session timeout for inactive users
- Add two-factor authentication for admin users
- Encrypt sensitive user data at rest

Let me show you how to implement these security enhancements..."
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### **1. Be Specific in Your Questions**
- ‚ùå "How do I add a new feature?"
- ‚úÖ "I want to add a revenue tracking dashboard that shows monthly trends for enterprise admins. What components and APIs do I need?"

### **2. Reference Existing Patterns**
- ‚ùå "Create a new API endpoint"
- ‚úÖ "Create a new API endpoint following the same patterns as the analytics router, with proper RBAC and tenant isolation"

### **3. Ask for Explanations**
- ‚ùå "Generate the code"
- ‚úÖ "Generate the code and explain how it follows our multi-tenant security patterns"

### **4. Iterate and Refine**
- Start with a basic implementation
- Ask Claude to review and improve it
- Test the code
- Ask for optimizations
