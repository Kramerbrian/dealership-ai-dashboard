3. **Share-to-Unlock Modals** → Feature unlocking system ✅

#### ⚠️ CTAs Needing Activation

### Actions Taken

## ✅ Phase 2: Dashboard Audit (dash.dealershipai.com)

### Current State
- ✅ **Dashboard**: `app/dash/page.tsx` exists
- ✅ **Clerk Middleware**: Configured with protected routes
- ✅ **Layout**: Has SignInButton/SignUpButton in header
- ⚠️ **Onboarding**: Needs verification

### Protected Routes (Middleware)
```typescript
- /dashboard(.*) → Protected
- /intelligence(.*) → Protected  
- /api/ai(.*) → Protected
- /dash → Should be protected (but not in list - needs fix)
```

### Issues Found
1. ⚠️ `/dash` not in protected routes list
2. ⚠️ `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` should be in public routes (already are ✅)

### Actions Needed
- [ ] Add `/dash` to protected routes
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify onboarding redirect

---

## 🔐 Phase 3: OAuth Integration Status

### Clerk Configuration
- ✅ **Secret Key**: Configured in `.env.local` and Vercel
- ✅ **Allowed Origins**: `https://*.vercel.app` configured
- ✅ **Sign-in URL**: `/sign-in`
- ✅ **Sign-up URL**: `/sign-up`
- ✅ **After signup**: `/dash`

### OAuth Providers (Configured in Clerk Dashboard)

## 🌐 Phase 4: Domain Configuration

### DNS Requirements for dash.dealershipai.com

Name: dash
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

**Option 2: A Record**

### Conversion Paths

2. **Dashboard → Upgrade Modal → Checkout** ⚠️ (needs verification)
3. **Session Limit Hit → Upgrade Prompt** ⚠️ (needs verification)
