- RLS is disabled for development - **must enable for production**
- Clerk keys are test keys - update with production keys for deployment
- Pricing page is standalone HTML - can be hosted separately or integrated into Next.js

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test connection
node test-db-simple.js

# If permission denied:
# - Check SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in .env.local
# - Verify RLS is disabled in Supabase

# If tables not found:
# - Deploy DEPLOY-THIS-SCHEMA.sql in Supabase SQL editor
```

### Dev Server Issues
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Pricing Page Not Connecting
```bash
# Verify environment variables
grep CLERK .env.local

# Check auth endpoint
curl http://localhost:3002/api/auth/status
```
