# DealershipAI Domain Configuration Guide

## 🌐 Current Domain Status

### ✅ Already Configured
- **dealershipai.com** → `dealershipai-landing` project (Landing Page)
- **dash.dealershipai.com** → `dealershipai-dashboard` project (Intelligence Dashboard)

### 🚀 Current Deployment
- **Production URL**: https://dealershipai-dashboard-77fe0bcs5-brian-kramers-projects.vercel.app
- **Status**: ✅ Ready and Live

## 📋 Domain Configuration Steps

### 1. Main Domain (dealershipai.com)
The main domain is already configured and pointing to the landing page project.

### 2. Dashboard Subdomain (dash.dealershipai.com)
The dashboard subdomain is already configured and pointing to our current project.

### 3. Verify Domain Configuration
To verify the domains are working correctly:

```bash
# Check main domain
curl -I https://dealershipai.com

# Check dashboard subdomain  
curl -I https://dash.dealershipai.com
```

## 🔧 Routing Configuration

### Current Routing Structure
```
dealershipai.com/          → Landing Page (dealershipai-landing project)
dash.dealershipai.com/     → Intelligence Dashboard (dealershipai-dashboard project)
dash.dealershipai.com/intelligence → Intelligence Dashboard (same project)
```

### Recommended Routing Updates
To ensure proper routing, we should update the Vercel configuration:

1. **Main Domain Routing**: Ensure `dealershipai.com` serves the landing page
2. **Dashboard Routing**: Ensure `dash.dealershipai.com` serves the intelligence dashboard
3. **Fallback Routing**: Handle any missing routes gracefully

## 🛠️ Next Steps for Domain Optimization

### 1. SSL Certificate
- ✅ Automatically handled by Vercel
- Certificates are auto-renewed

### 2. DNS Configuration
Ensure your DNS is pointing to Vercel:
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.61

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Type: CNAME
Name: dash
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### 3. Analytics Integration
Add analytics to track performance:
- Google Analytics 4
- Vercel Analytics
- Custom event tracking

### 4. Performance Monitoring
Set up monitoring for:
- Core Web Vitals
- API response times
- Error rates
- Uptime monitoring
