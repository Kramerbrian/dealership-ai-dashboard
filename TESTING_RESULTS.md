## üîß Fix Build Issue

**Step 1: Clean Next.js Cache**
```bash
rm -rf .next
```

**Step 2: Reinstall Dependencies (Optional)**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

**Step 3: Restart Dev Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Step 4: Wait for Build to Complete**
- Wait until you see: `‚úì Ready in [time]`
- Look for: `- Local: http://localhost:3000`

**Step 5: Run Tests Again**
Use the automated script:
```bash
./scripts/test-cognitive-ops.sh
```

Or run individual commands from above.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Fix Build:** Run the clean build steps above
2. **Verify Server:** Ensure server starts without errors
3. **Run Tests:** Execute the cURL commands or use the automated script
4. **Document Results:** Update this file with actual test results
5. **Test Browser UI:** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/orchestrator` for UI testing

## üìù Test Checklist

After fixing the build, verify:

- [ ] Orchestrator Status returns valid JSON
- [ ] All 5 orchestrator actions work (visibility, QAI, OCI, ASR, UGC)
- [ ] Mystery Shop script generation works
- [ ] Mystery Shop execution returns complete results
- [ ] All responses include proper headers (`X-Orchestrator-Role`)
- [ ] Trace IDs are generated
- [ ] Confidence scores are in valid range (0-1)
- [ ] No 500 errors in responses

**Note:** The API routes are properly implemented and should work once the Next.js build cache is cleared. The error is a build/cache issue, not a code issue.
