# You're Invisible to ChatGPT
## And it's costing you $45,200 a month

ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity — they're all recommending
the dealer down the street. Not you.

# $45,200
## Slipping through your hands every month

Look, I've been in the tower long enough to know BS when I see it.
This ain't BS.

While you're here, ChatGPT just sent another customer to [Competitor].
That's deal #847 this month. They're probably popping bottles.

Your AI Visibility Score: 64/100
[Competitor]'s Score: 82/100

That 18-point gap? That's why you're losing deals you don't even know about.

## Testing Your Copy

**The 3-Question Test**:

1. **Could this be said by a corporate robot?**
   - If yes → rewrite

2. **Would a 10-year tower veteran actually say this?**
   - If no → rewrite

3. **Does it make you smirk, even slightly?**
   - If no → add personality

**The Sales Manager Test**:
- Read it out loud in your best sales manager voice
- If it sounds fake, it is fake
- If it sounds like a pep talk from corporate, burn it

---

## Key Principles

1. **Respect Intelligence**: Users are smart. Don't patronize.

2. **Acknowledge Reality**: Dealers are busy, skeptical, and have been burned before.

3. **Show, Don't Tell**: "You're losing $45K" beats "Our platform optimizes visibility"

4. **Self-Aware Humor**: We know we sound like another sales pitch. Address it.

5. **No False Urgency**: Use real deadlines (end of month, competitor activity)

6. **ROI Always**: Everything ties back to dollars and deals

7. **Dealership Context**: Reference real scenarios they live every day

---

## Examples in the Wild

### Good Copy from Real Dealership Life

```
"Your score dropped faster than a credit app with 14 repos."

"You're #3 in your market. Like winning bronze at the Olympics.
Sure, it's a medal. But everyone remembers gold."

"This takes less time than explaining GAP insurance."

"Your competitor's score is 82. Yours is 64.
That's like showing up to a deal with last month's incentives."

"You've got 3/5 scans left this month.
Use them or lose them. Like rollover minutes. But less stupid."
```

## Voice Checklist

Before publishing any copy, ask:

- [ ] Would a real sales manager say this?
- [ ] Is it direct and honest?
- [ ] Does it reference actual dealership life?
- [ ] Is the humor dry, not cheesy?
- [ ] Does it respect the reader's intelligence?
- [ ] Is there a clear, practical next step?
- [ ] Would I roll my eyes if I read this?
- [ ] Does it sound like everyone else, or like us?

---

**Remember**: We're the veteran tower manager who's seen it all. We don't BS. We don't oversell. We just tell you what's broken and how to fix it. With a dry smile.

Because if you can't laugh at this industry, you'll cry. And crying doesn't close deals.

---

**Final Test**: If it sounds like it could be in a marketing agency pitch deck, rewrite it.

If it sounds like something said at 9pm on a slow Saturday in the tower, ship it.
