## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ What's Working
- **Production builds**: All recent deployments marked ● Ready
- **Code quality**: Landing page component created
- **Middleware**: Configured with public routes
- **Environment variables**: Configured in Vercel

### ⚠️ Known Issue
- **Vercel SSO**: The Vercel team/organization has SSO enabled for this project
- **Impact**: `.vercel.app` preview URLs redirect to Vercel login page
- **Workaround**: Deployments succeed, but URLs require authentication to view

### 🔧 Resolution Options

**Option 1: Use Custom Domain (Recommended)**
```bash
# The custom domain 'dealershipai-app.com' is already configured
# Wait for SSL certificate to finish being created
# Then access: https://dealershipai-app.com
```

**Option 2: Disable Vercel SSO (Requires Admin)**
- Go to Vercel dashboard → Team Settings → SSO
- Temporarily disable SSO for preview deployments
- Allows public access to `.vercel.app` URLs

**Option 3: Deploy to Individual Account**
- Move project to personal Vercel account
- No team-level SSO restrictions

## 📝 Current Configuration

### Environment Variables

### Middleware Configuration
```typescript

## 🎯 Next Steps
