# ✅ Node.js Version Warning - Fixed

## 🔍 Issue
Vercel was warning about automatic Node.js version upgrades:
```
Warning: Detected "engines": { "node": ">=18.0.0" } in your `package.json` 
that will automatically upgrade when a new major Node.js Version is released.
```

## ✅ Solution
Updated `package.json` to pin Node.js to a specific major version:

**Before:**
```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=18.0.0",
  "npm": ">=8.0.0"
}
```

**After:**
```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=22.0.0 <23.0.0",
  "npm": ">=8.0.0"
}
```

## 📊 Why This Fix Works

1. **Pins to Node 22.x**: Matches your current Vercel deployment (Node 22.x)
2. **Prevents Auto-Upgrades**: The `<23.0.0` upper bound prevents automatic upgrades to Node 23+
3. **Allows Patch Updates**: Still allows Node 22.0.0 → 22.1.0 → 22.2.0 updates
4. **Removes Warning**: Vercel won't show the warning anymore

## 🚀 Next Steps

The change will take effect on your next deployment:

```bash
# Commit the change
git add package.json
git commit -m "Pin Node.js version to 22.x to prevent auto-upgrades"

# Deploy
npx vercel --prod
```

## 📝 Alternative Versions

If you need a different Node.js version:

- **Node 20.x LTS** (more stable):
  ```json
  "node": ">=20.0.0 <21.0.0"
  ```

- **Node 18.x** (older LTS):
  ```json
  "node": ">=18.0.0 <19.0.0"
  ```

**Current choice**: Node 22.x (matches your active deployment)

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Warning will disappear on next deployment
