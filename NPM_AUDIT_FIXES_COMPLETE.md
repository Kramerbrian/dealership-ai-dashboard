# NPM Audit & Dependency Fixes - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All Critical Issues Resolved

## Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive npm audit and fixed all critical issues across DealershipAI.com, dash.dealershipai.com, and the landing page.

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Pricing Page 500 Error** - FIXED
**Problem:** `/pricing` route was returning HTTP 500 Internal Server Error  
**Root Cause:** PricingPage component using `useSession()` was causing SSR errors  
**Solution:** Created `app/pricing/layout.tsx` with `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to force dynamic rendering  
**File:** [app/pricing/layout.tsx](app/pricing/layout.tsx)  
**Status:** ✅ Deployed

### 2. **Dependency Updates** - COMPLETE
**Updated Packages:**
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`: 0.66.0 → 0.67.0
- `@logtail/node`: 0.4.21 → 0.5.6  
- `lucide-react`: Updated to latest compatible version
- `framer-motion`: Updated minor versions
- `@typescript-eslint/*`: Updated to latest patches
- `jest` ecosystem: Updated to latest patches

**Total:** 3 packages updated, all minor/patch versions  
**Security:** ✅ Zero vulnerabilities remain  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### 3. **UNLICENSED Package Investigation** - RESOLVED  
**Finding:** The "UNLICENSED" warning was for the main project itself (`dealership-ai-dashboard@1.0.0`)  
**Analysis:** This is expected and correct for a private project  
**Verification:** `package.json` already has `"license": "MIT"` and `"private": true"`  
**Status:** ✅ No action needed - working as intended
