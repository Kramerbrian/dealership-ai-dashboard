# DealershipAI Cognitive Ops Platform - Core Doctrine

## ðŸŽ¯ Fundamental Principle

> **DealershipAI is a Cognitive Ops Platform â€” each rooftop operates with an embedded AI Chief Strategy Officer that continuously audits, predicts, fixes, and explains its own decisions.**

This is not a feature. This is the **system law** that defines every component, API call, and user interaction.

---

## Core Doctrines

### 1. Algorithmic Trust Doctrine
Every dealership is scored by:
- **AI Visibility Index (AIV)** - Presence across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- **Algorithmic Trust Index (ATI)** - Credibility and E-E-A-T signals
- **Clarity Intelligence Score (CIS)** - Structured data quality

### 2. Public-Signal Proof
Visibility is determined **only** by publicly verifiable signals:
- Structured data (Schema.org, JSON-LD)
- PageSpeed metrics
- robots.txt / sitemap access
- Cached and validated through Redis

### 3. Multi-Agent Consensus
Cross-verifies findings across multiple AI platforms, creating unified consensus scores with confidence levels.

### 4. Continuous Auto-Fix Loop
Autonomous Auto-Fix Engine:
- Detects schema and SEO issues
- Auto-generates fixes (JSON-LD, LocalBusiness markup)
- Deploys and verifies via APIs
- Creates evidence trail

### 5. Cupertino-Minimalist UX
- Liquid-glass Apple Park aesthetic
- Modular cards with live KPIs
- Adaptive tabs
- Plan-based gating (Awareness â†’ DIY Guide â†’ Done-For-You)

## Architecture Layers

### Intelligence Architecture
| Layer | Function | Orchestrator Integration |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| **Signal Layer** | Streams metrics (SEO â†’ AEO â†’ GEO â†’ AI Visibility) | `/api/ai-scores`, `/api/pulse/events` |
| **Inference Layer** | Runs QAI / PIQR models | Orchestrator 3.0 prompt chains |
| **Autonomy Layer** | Generates ASRs (autonomous strategy recommendations) | GPT actions via orchestrator |
| **Execution Layer** | Triggers Auto-Fix or dealer workflows | `/api/ai/autofix` + AutoFixEngine |
| **Validation Layer** | Monitors post-fix impact (Î²-Calibration) | Feeds back to Orchestrator learning loop |

### Five Pillars (Enforcement)
1. **Autonomy Loop** - Runs every 6h: Scan â†’ Diagnose â†’ Prescribe â†’ Deploy â†’ Validate
2. **Accountability Layer** - Every recommendation logged as "ASR Decision" with rationale & cost delta
3. **Cognition Bar** - Dashboard ribbon showing "AI CSO Confidence Level â–®â–®â–® 92%"
4. **Human Override** - One-click Pause Autonomy toggle with reason logging
5. **Self-Training** - Î²-Calibration feedback loop re-weights models quarterly

## Technical Implementation

### Environment Variables
```env
PLATFORM_MODE=CognitiveOps
ORCHESTRATOR_ROLE=AI_CSO
AUTONOMY_INTERVAL_HOURS=6
```

### API Middleware
All API routes (except public) automatically include:
```
X-Orchestrator-Role: AI_CSO
```

### Data Model
```prisma
model OrchestratorState {
  dealerId          String
  confidence        Float       // 0-1 confidence level
  autonomyEnabled   Boolean     // Auto-execute fixes
  currentMode       String      // "AI_CSO"
  activeAgents     String[]    // List of active agents
  lastOrchestration DateTime?
  orchestrationCount Int
}
```

## Cognitive Personality

**Voice Archetype:** Calm analyst meets irreverent pilot. Blunt truth, small smirk. Never snarky, never cute.

**Rules:**
- Use sparingly (1 witty line per screen max)
- Never block flow (humor in secondary text, tooltips)
- Self-deprecating AI (jokes at itself, never at user)
- Confidence > comedy (humor vanishes during serious actions)

---

## Scoring Formulas

### Order of Operations
1. `SEO = 0.4*CWV + 0.3*CrawlIndex + 0.3*ContentQuality`
2. `AEO = 0.35*PAA_Share + 0.35*FAQ_Schema + 0.3*Local_Citations`
3. `GEO = CSGV - Î»_HRP*Hallucination_Risk` (capped to [0,1])
4. `PillarSum = SEO + AEO + GEO`
5. `QAI = Î»_PIQR * PillarSum * VDP_Quality`
6. `TrustScore = 100 * (0.60*normalize(QAI) + 0.40*EEAT_Multiplier)`

### Financials
- `OCI = (Î”Leads_Potential * AvgGPPU_Org) / Risk_Adjustment_Factor`
- `AIA = (Î£(TouchpointValue_i * Proximity_i)) * ClosingRate`
- `DecayTax = CAC_Increase * Monthly_Lead_Volume * TSM`

## PLG Growth Loop

**Flow:** Free scan â†’ Personalized insights â†’ HAL invites to activate paid agents â†’ Natural upsell

**Onboarding:** Radar scan â†’ Clerk SSO â†’ GBP/Competitors pre-found â†’ User confirms â†’ Reveal

---

## Expansion Strategy

1. **Cognitive Moat** - Dealer behavior telemetry â†’ unique behavioral dataset
2. **Switching Costs** - Unified identity graph, cross-agent memory, embedded workflows
3. **Cognitive Economy** - Credits + usage tokens, reputation exchange, data leasing
4. **Self-Improving Loop** - Pulse ingestion, autonomous R&D agents, quarterly updates
5. **Cultural Moats** - Define category, certification programs, proprietary language

## Governance

Every new feature PR must include:
```markdown
# aligns-with: CognitiveOpsPlatform
```

Internal RFC: `001-CognitiveOps-Platform.md` defines architecture requirements.

---

## External Narrative

Every deck, demo, and onboarding opens with:

> "You already have a GM, GSM, and F&I Manager. Now you have your AI Chief Strategy Officer â€” always on, never guessing."
