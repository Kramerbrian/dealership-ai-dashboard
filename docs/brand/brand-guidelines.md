# Visual & Verbal Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- Liquid-glass backgrounds, soft shadows (soft-2), rounded-md radii.
- Calm gradients for highlights; no harsh saturation.
- Icons: lucide; sparing color, rely on weight + motion.

## Typographic Scale
- 36/28/22 for headings; 16 body; 14 label.

## Verbal Identity
- Short, declarative, benefit-first lines.
- Replace acronyms with labels (use the Core Web Vitals block pattern).

## Content System
- Explainers: headline → 2 lines → action.
- Evidence packets: JSON now, HTML/print later.

## Don't
- Don't bury the CTA.
- Don't show a metric without a fix or explanation.
