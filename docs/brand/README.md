# dealershipAI – Brand & UX Canon (Clay-Aligned)

This canon merges Clay Global's GTM, design systems, human-centered UX, and AI-infused creative approach with dealershipAI's North-Star UI.

## Core Principles
1) **Brand × UX = One System** – visual and verbal identity are encoded in the design system, not layered on top.
2) **Clarity → Action** – every screen answers: *what should I do next?* (fix, compare, simulate, export).
3) **Zero-Click Era Ready** – optimize for AI surfaces first; the product teaches users with hover cards + 'Show me why' drawers.
4) **Human, Fast, Consistent** – liquid-glass calm, bold hierarchy, motion with purpose, and accessible defaults.
5) **AI as a Creative Partner** – use AI to ideate, research, summarize, and personalize while preserving editorial control.

## GTM Guardrails (Clay-style)
- **Discovery → Positioning → Design System → Launch Ops** (not just visuals).
- **Role-by-Role Journeys** (GM, Marketing, Used Car Dir, Service Dir): each gets a focused dashboard lens and CTA.
- **Evidence → Trust**: every insight can export an evidence packet; every metric explains itself.

## Locked Taglines
- Canon hero: *Your real-time dealership diagnostic dashboard.*
- Sound bite: *dealershipAI doesn't just show where you stand — it shows you what to fix next to win the click (or zero-click) before your competitors even realize what's happening.*
