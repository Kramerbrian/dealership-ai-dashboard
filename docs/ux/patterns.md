# UX Patterns (Clay-Aligned)

## 1) Action-first Cards
- Headline metric → one primary CTA (Fix Now / Compare / Simulate / Export)
- Secondary links: "Show me why" (explainers) and "Evidence"

## 2) Real-time Visibility
- Freshness badges (e.g., "updated 4m ago").
- Momentum arrows (MoM/WoW) on RI, SCS, GCS.

## 3) Role-specific Layouts
- GM: KPIs, RaR/OCI, Overlay
- Marketing: CWV, Schema Fix-Now, Citations
- Used: Valuation & Anchors, VOI, Simulator
- Service/Parts: Service visibility, Fitment integrity

## 4) Motion & Audio (North-Star)
- Morph + Orbit Realignment for mode switches.
- Chime on successful fix; minor-interval warn for risk; hover tick micro-feedback.

## 5) Accessibility & Simplicity
- 8-point spacing, 16px min interactive, contrast ≥ 4.5, reduced motion mode.
