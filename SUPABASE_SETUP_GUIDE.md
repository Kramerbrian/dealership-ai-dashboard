# Supabase Setup Guide - DealershipAI Platform

## Overview

This guide will help you complete the Supabase integration for the DealershipAI multi-tenant platform. Your database schema has been successfully deployed with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforcing tenant isolation.

## Database Status

✅ **8 tables created successfully:**
- `tenants` - Organization/tenant management
- `users` - User accounts with role-based permissions
- `dealerships` - Individual dealership locations
- `ai_visibility_audits` - AI visibility scan results
- `optimization_recommendations` - Actionable improvement suggestions
- `ai_citations` - AI-generated content citations
- `competitor_analysis` - Competitive intelligence data
- `activity_feed` - System activity logging

✅ **Sample data inserted:**
- 2 test tenants (Enterprise and Single Dealership)
- 3 dealerships across different tenants
- All RLS policies enabled and active

## Step 1: Update Environment Variables with Real Supabase Keys

### Current Status
Your `.env` file currently has placeholder values for Supabase credentials:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://vxrdvkhkombwlhjvtsmw.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key_here
```

### Action Required

1. **The Supabase API settings page has been opened in your browser**
   - If not, navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vxrdvkhkombwlhjvtsmw/settings/api

2. **Copy your API keys:**
   - Find the **"anon public"** key (under Project API keys)
   - Find the **"service_role"** key (under Project API keys - keep this secret!)

3. **Update your `.env` file:**

```bash
# Replace the placeholder values with your real keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://vxrdvkhkombwlhjvtsmw.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...  # Paste your anon key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...  # Paste your service_role key
```

4. **Also update `.env.local` if you're using it for local development**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:**
- The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` bypasses ALL Row-Level Security policies
- NEVER expose this key in client-side code or commit it to public repositories
- Only use it in server-side API routes and backend services

## Step 2: Clerk Authentication Integration

### Current Status
✅ Clerk is already configured in your project:
- Middleware set up at `/Users/briankramer/dealership-ai-dashboard/middleware.ts`
- Environment variables defined in `.env`
- Authentication helpers in place

### Verification Steps

1. **Check your Clerk credentials in `.env`:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

2. **If you need to update Clerk keys:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
   - Select your application
   - Navigate to API Keys
   - Copy the keys and update your `.env` file

3. **Test Clerk authentication:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then visit http://localhost:3001/sign-in to test the login flow.

## Step 3: API Endpoints

### Created Endpoints

The following API endpoints have been created to interact with your Supabase database:

#### Dealerships API
- `GET /api/dealerships` - List all dealerships for user's tenant
- `POST /api/dealerships` - Create new dealership
- `GET /api/dealerships/[id]` - Get specific dealership
- `PATCH /api/dealerships/[id]` - Update dealership
- `DELETE /api/dealerships/[id]` - Delete dealership

#### Audits API
- `GET /api/audits` - List AI visibility audits
- `POST /api/audits` - Create new audit
- `GET /api/audits/[id]` - Get specific audit
- `PATCH /api/audits/[id]` - Update audit
- `DELETE /api/audits/[id]` - Delete audit

#### Recommendations API
- `GET /api/recommendations` - List optimization recommendations
- `POST /api/recommendations` - Create new recommendation
- `GET /api/recommendations/[id]` - Get specific recommendation
- `PATCH /api/recommendations/[id]` - Update recommendation
- `DELETE /api/recommendations/[id]` - Delete recommendation

### API Features
- ✅ Clerk authentication required
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Tenant isolation enforced
- ✅ Pagination support
- ✅ Filtering by query parameters
- ✅ Full CRUD operations

### Example API Calls

**Get dealerships for authenticated user:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/dealerships \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_TOKEN"
```

**Create a new audit:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/audits \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dealership_id": "uuid-here",
    "ai_visibility_score": 85.5,
    "seo_score": 78.2,
    "status": "completed"
  }'
```

**Get recommendations for a dealership:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/recommendations?dealership_id=uuid-here" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_TOKEN"
```

## Step 4: Test RLS Policies

### Test Script Created

A comprehensive RLS testing script has been created at:
`/Users/briankramer/dealership-ai-dashboard/test-rls-policies.ts`

### How to Run Tests

1. **Install dependencies (if needed):**
```bash
npm install --save-dev ts-node @types/node
```

2. **Run the test script:**
```bash
npx ts-node test-rls-policies.ts
```

### What the Tests Verify

The test suite validates:

1. **Dealership Access Control**
   - Users can only access their tenant's dealerships
   - Cross-tenant access is blocked

2. **Audit Access Control**
   - Users can only see audits for their tenant
   - Cannot create audits for other tenants

3. **Recommendation Access Control**
   - Recommendations are tenant-isolated
   - Proper permission checks for CRUD operations

4. **Cross-Tenant Isolation**
   - Complete data separation between tenants
   - No data leakage across tenant boundaries

5. **Super Admin Access**
   - Super admins can access all tenants
   - Proper privilege escalation

### Expected Output

```

## Step 5: Role-Based Testing

### User Roles in the System

1. **super_admin**
   - Access to all tenants
   - Full system management
   - Can manage all users and settings

2. **enterprise_admin**
   - Manages one enterprise tenant
   - Can access all dealerships under their tenant
   - Can manage users within their tenant

3. **dealership_admin**
   - Manages a single dealership
   - Can view and edit their dealership's data
   - Limited user management

4. **user**
   - Read-only access
   - Can view analytics for their dealership
   - Cannot make changes

### Testing Different Roles

To test with different roles, you'll need to:

1. **Create test users in Clerk:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
   - Create users with different email addresses
   - Note their Clerk user IDs

2. **Add users to Supabase:**
```sql
-- Example: Add an enterprise admin
INSERT INTO users (clerk_id, tenant_id, email, role)
VALUES (
  'user_clerk_id_here',
  'tenant_id_here',
  'admin@example.com',
  'enterprise_admin'
);
```

3. **Test API access with different users:**
   - Sign in as each user type
   - Test the API endpoints
   - Verify proper access control
