## 🎯 Alternative: Exact Navigation Paths

The exact location varies by Clerk interface version:

```
Dashboard → Settings → Allowed Origins
```

**Version 2 (Older)**:

Dashboard → Configure → Paths → Frontend API → Allowed Origins
```

**Version 3**:

Dashboard → Settings → Paths → Add Allowed Origin
```

**If you can't find it**:
- Use the search bar in Clerk dashboard
- Search for: "allowed origins" or "CORS" or "frontend api"

## 📋 URLs to Add

Add these specific URLs:

```
https://*.vercel.app                           (all Vercel deployments)
https://dealership-ai-dashboard-*.vercel.app  (specific pattern)
https://dealershipai.com                      (custom domain)
https://www.dealershipai.com                  (custom domain www)
https://dealershipai-app.com                  (alternative domain)
```

## ✅ What This Fixes

- ✅ Removes "Invalid host" error on Vercel preview URLs
- ✅ Allows Clerk authentication to work on deployments
- ✅ Doesn't affect security (only adds allowed origins)
- ✅ Takes effect in 1-2 minutes

## 🔒 Security Note

Only add `https://` URLs (never `http://`).
Wildcards like `*.vercel.app` are safe because:
- They only match Vercel's verified domains
- They require HTTPS
- They're scoped to your specific deployment pattern

## 🎉 After Adding

Once you've added the URLs and saved:

1. Wait 1-2 minutes
2. Refresh your browser
3. Visit the deployment URL
4. The error should be gone!

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If you can't find the "Allowed Origins" section:

1. Check if you're on the right application in Clerk
2. Look for "CORS" or "Frontend API" sections
3. Contact Clerk support or check their docs:
   - https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/frontend-cors

## 📝 Summary

**Problem**: Vercel `.vercel.app` URLs not in Clerk allowed origins  
**Solution**: Add `https://*.vercel.app` to Clerk Dashboard  
**Time**: 2 minutes  
**Result**: Works on all Vercel deployments ✅
