# Landing Page Missing Components

The user requested adding missing components to resolve `ReferenceError: Logos is not defined`.

However, looking at the current landing page implementations, they all use different architectures:

1. **app/page.tsx** → Uses `EnhancedLandingPage` from `components/landing/EnhancedLandingPage`
2. **app/landing/enhanced-schema/page.tsx** → Uses schema-based components
3. **Multiple other landing pages** → Various implementations

## The Issue

The components requested (Logos, Explainers, QuickAudit, Pricing, CTA, Footer) are from a different landing page architecture that was discussed in a previous chat but may not be actively in use.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Create a New Landing Page
Create a new file with these specific components as requested.

### Option 2: Update Existing Landing Page  
Add these components to the current `app/components/landing/EnhancedLandingPage.tsx`

### Option 3: Identify Correct File
Find the exact file where these components are being referenced so we can add them.

## Recommended Action

Ask the user which landing page file they want us to update, or if they want me to create a new landing page with these specific components.
