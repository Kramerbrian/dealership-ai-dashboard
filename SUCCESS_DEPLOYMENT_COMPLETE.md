## 🔄 Automatic Deployment

Since your repository is connected to Vercel, the deployment happens automatically!

### Current Status:
1. ✅ **GitHub**: Code pushed successfully
2. 🔄 **Vercel**: Building and deploying automatically
3. ⏳ **Domain**: Will be available after Vercel finishes building

### Monitor Deployment:
- Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Build Logs: Check your Vercel project dashboard

---

## 🌐 Configure Your Domain

Once Vercel finishes deploying, configure your custom domain:

### Step 1: Add Custom Domain in Vercel
```bash
vercel domains add dealershipai.com
```

### Step 2: Configure DNS
In your domain registrar (where you own `dealershipai.com`):

```
Type    Name    Value
A       @       76.76.21.21
CNAME   www     cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Step 3: Wait for DNS Propagation
- Usually takes 5-30 minutes
- Check DNS propagation: https://dnschecker.org

## 🔧 Configure Environment Variables

Add these to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

### Required for Production:
```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx

# Supabase Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxx
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx

# Redis/Upstash
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://xxx.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=xxx

# Stripe Payments
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx

## 🧪 Test Your Deployment

### 1. Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://dealershipai.com/api/health
```

### 2. Test Zero-Click APIs
```bash
# Test summary endpoint
curl "https://dealershipai.com/api/zero-click/summary?tenantId=demo&days=30"

# Test recompute endpoint
curl -X POST https://dealershipai.com/api/zero-click/recompute
```

### 3. Test Authentication
```bash
curl https://dealershipai.com/auth/signin
```

### 4. Test Dashboard
```bash
curl https://dealershipai.com/dashboard
curl https://dealershipai.com/intelligence
```

---

## 🔄 Configure Cron Jobs

Set up automated Zero-Click recompute in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Cron Jobs:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "path": "/api/zero-click/recompute",
      "schedule": "0 */4 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

This will trigger Zero-Click recompute every 4 hours automatically.
