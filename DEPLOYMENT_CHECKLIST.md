vercel --prod

# Option B: Using npm script
npm run deploy

# Option C: Push to main branch (auto-deploy via GitHub integration)
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations
```bash
# After deployment succeeds, run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://dealershipai.com/api/health

# Test Pulse endpoints
curl 'https://dealershipai.com/api/pulse/score?dealerId=demo-123'
curl 'https://dealershipai.com/api/pulse/radar?dealerId=demo-123'
curl 'https://dealershipai.com/api/pulse/trends?dealerId=demo-123&days=30'
```

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

### Configure DNS
At your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.):

```
Type: CNAME
Name: dash
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 3600
```

### Verify DNS Propagation
```bash
dig dash.dealershipai.com CNAME +short
# Should return: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Add Domain to Vercel
```bash
npx vercel domains add dash.dealershipai.com
```

### Update Clerk Origins
```bash
./update-clerk-origins-direct.sh
```

- [ ] Enable log streaming
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

### Alerts
- [ ] Error rate alerts
- [ ] Response time alerts
- [ ] Database connection alerts
- [ ] API quota alerts

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Via Vercel dashboard: Deployments â†’ Previous deployment â†’ Promote
# Or via CLI:
vercel rollback
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# If migration issues:
npx prisma migrate reset
# Then restore from backup
```
