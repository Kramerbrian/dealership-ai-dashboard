## ⚠️ Remaining Action: Fix Clerk "Invalid host" Error

The deployment is successful, but you still need to:

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard**: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. **Select your application**
3. **Navigate to**: Configure → Paths → Frontend API
4. **Add allowed origin**: `https://*.vercel.app`
5. **Save**

**Why?** This allows Clerk authentication to work on Vercel preview URLs.

**See detailed instructions**: `QUICK_CLERK_FIX.md`
