### **Updated Integration Requirements**

#### **Required (Choose One)**
- **Google Business Profile** - Track local AI search visibility
- **Website URL** - Core website analysis and performance tracking
- **OR Both** - Maximum AI visibility tracking accuracy (recommended)

#### **Optional Integrations**

- **Facebook Business** - Monitor AI-generated content reach
- **Instagram Business** - Visual content AI visibility
- **YouTube Channel** - Video content AI optimization
- **CRM Systems** - Lead quality insights
- **Review Platforms** - Reputation monitoring
