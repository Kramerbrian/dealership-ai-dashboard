"""
Enterprise Multi‑Agent Platform for dealershipAI
=================================================

This module implements a multi‑agent system designed to collect,
analyze and synthesize information about an automotive dealership’s
digital presence across several AI search engines and review platforms.

The system is composed of the following agents:

* **QueryAgent** – Generates relevant search queries based on the
  dealership name and location. For example, it might produce queries
  like ``"Toyota dealership near Naples FL"`` or ``"Naples Toyota
  service center reviews"``. Query generation can be as simple as
  templated phrases or could be extended to use machine learning
  models.

* **PlatformAgent** – Executes the search queries against multiple
  online platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google Search and Gemini) in
  parallel. Each platform returns a structured result indicating
  whether the dealership was mentioned and, if so, the context of the
  mention. In this example implementation the actual API calls are
  abstracted behind helper methods. When integrating with real
  services you can replace the placeholders with code that invokes
  HTTP APIs or SDKs (e.g. ``openai.ChatCompletion.create``). If
  network calls fail or rate limits are reached the agent returns
  partial results and logs the error.

* **AnalysisAgent** – Consumes the raw search results and produces
  analytical metrics. It calculates visibility scores, counts
  mentions across different platforms and highlights queries where the
  dealership is missing. This agent also computes a rough estimate of
  lost opportunities based on configurable conversion rates and
  average deal values. The formulas are illustrative and should be
  refined to match real business assumptions.

* **CompetitorAgent** – Performs a lightweight competitor analysis
  based on the same queries. It identifies which competitors are
  mentioned in the search results and ranks them. In a real system
  you could extend this with calls to external APIs or your own
  datasets to gather competitor metrics (e.g. reviews, pricing).

* **ReviewAgent** – Aggregates ratings and sentiment from various
  review sources. For demonstration purposes it returns random values
  in the 0–5 range and simple sentiment scores. In production this
  would integrate with Google Business Profile, Yelp, DealerRater,
  Reddit, Facebook or other review platforms. Because many of these
  sources lack official APIs, you may choose to build separate
  scraping services or rely on vendors that provide consolidated
  review data.

* **IntegrationAgent** – Orchestrates the execution of other agents
  and synthesizes their outputs into a single comprehensive report.
  This report contains the visibility analysis, competitor ranking,
  review summary and key insights. It is designed to be consumed by
  the frontend of your dashboard but could just as easily be
  delivered via email or stored in a database.

This architecture separates responsibilities into discrete, reusable
components and enables concurrent execution where appropriate. It
also allows you to swap out implementations—for example to replace
the dummy data with real API calls—without affecting the rest of the
system.

Usage example
-------------

Running this module as a script will execute an end‑to‑end analysis for
``"Toyota of Naples"`` and print a JSON summary. See the ``main``
section at the bottom for details. Set the appropriate environment
variables (e.g. ``OPENAI_API_KEY``, ``GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY``,
``GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID``) before invoking the script if you
intend to integrate real services.
