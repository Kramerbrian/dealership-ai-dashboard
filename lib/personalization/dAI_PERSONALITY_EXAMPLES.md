## Implementation Notes

### Scarcity Control
- **90% Default Text**: Standard, professional messaging
- **10% Easter Egg**: Personality-infused, quote-enhanced messaging
- **Selection Logic**: Usage Decay Weighting ensures freshness

### Quote Integration
- Quotes are **never forced**—only appear when context matches perfectly
- Quotes enhance the message, never replace it
- Attribution appears only for high subtlety quotes (subtletyIndex ≥ 4)

### Context Matching
- Minimum 20% context match required
- Context tags must align with user's situation
- Timing is critical—quotes land at contextual peaks

## Best Practices

1. **Let Seinfeld Set Up**: Use observational wrapper text to set up the quote
2. **Let Chappelle Time It**: Quote appears at the perfect moment
3. **Let Reynolds Be Quick**: Headlines are sharp and meta-aware
4. **Let Gillis Be Confident**: Dry, confident pivots without over-explanation
